"""Reference policy server for Symbiotic World: your Python agents drive organisms in the sim.

Standard library only (Python 3.9+), runs on macOS / Linux / Windows. The sim (on the
Windows host) connects to THIS process over TCP and asks it, once per logical substep,
which action each of your organisms takes. Protocol: docs/POLICY_API.md.

    python3 Tools/policy_server.py --agent bandit --port 9000
    python3 Tools/policy_server.py --agent my                    # your own class, see MyAgent below
    python3 Tools/policy_server.py --agent heuristic --record my_run.jsonl   # also log every exchange for policy_replay.py

Agents: random, bandit (tabular contextual bandit, gamma 0), heuristic (fixed rules on the
percept), tracefollower (uses the Trace X / Trace Y fields), my (yours). No Unreal on your
machine? Develop offline: replay a recording with Tools/policy_replay.py (see docs/POLICY_API.md,
"Offline development on a Mac").

Then tell the host your IP (macOS: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`); the host runs
    python Tools/run_sim.py --mode C --seed 7 --duration 600 --speed 20 --policy "<your ip>:9000=Lumen"

Every 5 s this prints decisions/s and the mean time act() took per request, so you can
see whether you are keeping the sim waiting (keep a whole request under a few ms: the
sim blocks for at most its timeout, default 200 ms, and falls back to its own bandit).

Wire format: one JSON object per line, UTF-8, '\\n' terminated, both directions.
  sim -> server  {"type":"hello", ...}                       once per connection / run
  sim -> server  {"type":"decide","t":..,"step":n,"agents":[...]}
  server -> sim  {"type":"actions","step":n,"actions":{"<id>":"forage", ...}}
  server -> sim  {"type":"log","text":"..."}                 optional, printed in the UE log

What an agent entry in "decide" contains (every field, see docs/POLICY_API.md for units):
  id            organism id (int, stable for its lifetime; reused never)
  species       "Lumen" | "Tecton"
  generation    0 for founders
  age, energy, max_energy
  bin           "LOW" | "MID" | "HIGH"   energy thirds, the built-in bandit's context
  bin_index     0 | 1 | 2
  mask          [7 ints] 1 = action feasible now (in ACTION order); choose only among these
  last_action   the action that just ended (your previous choice, or the built-in's on a fallback), or null
  last_reward   its reward = energy change / 10 (+ small interaction term), exact, or null on the first decision
  last_bin      the bin last_action was chosen in
  last_external true if last_action was your choice (false = built-in bandit chose, e.g. after a timeout)
  decisions     how many decisions this organism has made
  q             [3][7] floats: the organism's OWN tabular bandit values (a hint; it keeps learning)
  position      [x, y] in world units (uu; arena is +-world_half_size in x, +-world_half_size_y in y)
  heading       yaw in degrees
  percept       see PERCEPT_FIELDS below
