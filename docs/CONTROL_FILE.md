# Live control file

Perturb a running world without a restart and without touching its keyboard: append one
command per line to a text file, the sim executes each new line once. Meant for a scientist
(human or agent) driving experiments against a world that is also being watched or streamed.
Code: `ASWWorldManager::InitControlFile / PollControlFile / ExecuteControlCommand / RunControlCommand`
in `Source/SymbioticWorld/SWWorldManager.cpp`; helper: `Tools/control.py`.

## Path and polling

* **Path:** `Settings.ControlFile`, default `Saved/control.txt`, relative to the project directory
  (`<repo>/`). Change it with `-SWControlFile=<path>`, `run_sim.py --control-file <path>` or
  `--set "Settings.ControlFile=<path>"`; an empty value turns the watch off. The path is resolved once
  at startup (a later `set Settings.ControlFile=...` has no effect until the process restarts).
* **Poll:** every `Settings.ControlFilePollSec` seconds (default 2, minimum 0.25) of **wall** time,
  from the manager's per-frame `Tick`, before the fixed-step loop, never inside a logical substep and
  never touching the seeded stream. Polling continues while paused, so `pause=off` works. The file is
  re-read only when its size or modification time changed; with no file, or no new lines, the poll is
  a pure stat and nothing in the sim changes.
* **Startup:** the sim records the file's current line count and ignores those lines. Log line:
  `control file: <path>, N existing lines ignored, watching (polled every 2.0 s)` (or
  `... not present, watching ...`). So a file left over from yesterday does not replay.

## Semantics: an append-only command log

* Every newline-terminated line beyond the last executed one is executed **once**, in file order,
  then the cursor moves past it. A line without a trailing newline (still being written) waits for the
  next poll. `Tools/control.py` always writes complete lines and repairs a missing final newline first.
* Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are skipped. An inline ` # comment` (space, then `#`) is
  dropped from every command except `note=`, whose text is taken verbatim.
* If the file **shrinks** (someone truncated or rewrote it) the cursor is reset to the new line count and
  a log line says so; the remaining lines are treated as already seen, not re-executed. If the file is
  removed the cursor resets to 0, so a recreated file executes all of its lines. A rewrite that keeps the
  line count but changes an already-executed line is treated as new content: the cursor resets to 0 and every
  line of the new file executes once (so truncate-and-replace inside one poll window is not lost).
* Every executed line is logged as `control: <line> -> <result>` (UE log, `LogSymbioticWorld`) and
  appended to `<run dir>/commands.csv` (below). Unknown or malformed lines are logged and recorded as
  `rejected: ...`; they never stop the sim or the remaining lines.
* The run survives everything except `reset` / `mode`; the watch survives resets too (cursor and path
  are per process, not per run).

## Grammar

Keywords are case-insensitive; the line is trimmed; spaces around `=` are tolerated.

| command | effect | same code path as |
|---|---|---|
| `drought=on` / `drought=off` / `drought=toggle` | drought perturbation (`Settings.DroughtRegenMultiplier` / `DroughtCapacityMultiplier` on every patch, HUD banner, drought visuals). `on`/`off` are idempotent: `ok: drought already on` | key **P**: `ASWWorldManager::ToggleDrought()` |
| `speed=<float>` | time scale, clamped to `[0, 1000]` like the keys; `0` stops the logical clock without setting the pause flag | keys **1/2/3**: `SetTimeScale()` |
| `pause=on` / `pause=off` | pause flag, idempotent | key **Space**: `TogglePause()` |
| `set <Scope.Field>=<value>` | the `-SWSet` reflection on the **live** objects: scopes `Settings`, `Lumen`, `Tecton`, `Genome` (alias `Founder`), `Look`; colours as `r:g:b`; several items may be joined with `;` (`set Settings.MaxPopulation=300;Lumen.MaxAge=200`). Result `ok: k/n field(s) set`; a field that does not exist is a `SWSet: no property ...` warning and counts as not set | launch flag `-SWSet`: `ApplyParameterOverrides()` |
| `reset` | restart the run with the same seed and mode (new run id, new log directory) | key **R**: `ResetRun()` |
| `reset seed=<int>` | set `Settings.Seed`, then restart | `ResetRun()` |
| `mode=A|B|C|N` | switch the learning mode and restart | key **M** ends in the same `SetMode() -> ResetRun()` |
| `note=<text>` | recorded verbatim (result `ok: note recorded (n chars)`), kept as `ASWWorldManager::GetLatestNote()` for a later HUD panel; use it to mark experiment steps in `commands.csv` | none (bookkeeping) |

Do not use `set Settings.Mode=...` or `set Settings.Seed=...` to change mode or seed: the first changes
the learning rules mid-run without a reset (and the run id keeps the old mode name), the second only
applies at the next reset. `mode=` and `reset seed=` do the right thing.

## Which settings are live and which wait for a reset

`set` writes the manager's live structs. Whether the world reacts at once depends on where the field
is **read**; this list was taken from the code (2026-09-06).

**`Settings.*` read at use, so effective at once (next substep / next event):**
`MaxPopulation`, `DecisionInterval`, `LogicalSubstep`, `MaxSubstepsPerFrame`, `MutationSigma` (next
birth), `RewardScale`, `WeightEnergy`, `WeightNovelty`, `WeightInteraction`, `DroughtRegenMultiplier`,
`DroughtCapacityMultiplier`, `NeutralBirthInterval`, `AgentLogInterval`, `bTraceFields`,
`TraceXDeposit`, `TraceYDeposit`, `TraceYRegenGain`, `TraceXFollowMin`, `ModifyBurn`, `QInitMax`
(organisms born after the command), `PolicyShare` (births after the command), `PolicyFilePollSec`,
`ControlFilePollSec`. `TraceMax`: the reward scaling and the minimap use the new value at once, the
fields' clamp keeps the old one until the next reset.

**`Settings.*` read only at `StartRun`, so effective at the next `reset` / `mode=`:**
`InitialLumen`, `InitialTecton` (founders, and the neutral-control targets), `ResourcePatchesA`,
`ResourcePatchesB`, `PatchCapacity`, **`PatchRegenPerSec`** (each patch stores its regen at spawn, so a live
edit changes nothing until the patches are respawned), `TraceCells`, `TraceXHalfLife`, `TraceYHalfLife`
(the trace grids are built in `StartRun`), `Seed`, `Mode`, `FounderGenome` (the `Genome.` scope),
`FounderSpread`, `FounderAgeSpread`, `bWriteLogs`. `WorldHalfSize` is mixed (clamping and spawn positions
use the new value, the trace grids and the rendered arena keep the old one): treat it as reset-only.

**Process lifetime (not even a reset picks them up):** `PolicyServers`, `PolicyTimeoutMs`,
`PolicyServerFile`, `ControlFile` (all resolved in `BeginPlay`).

**`Lumen.*` / `Tecton.*`:** an organism copies its species struct at birth (`ASWAgent::Init`), so every
field (`ReproThreshold`, `MaxAge`, `MoveSpeed`, `ForageRate`, `BasalBurn`, `StartEnergy`, ...) applies to
organisms born **after** the command; living ones keep their copy. A population turns over within
`MaxAge` logical seconds (150 for Lumen, 300 for Tecton), or `reset` applies it to everyone at once.

**`Genome.*`:** the founder genome, used at the next `reset` / `mode=` (in mode B every child copies
its parent, so this is the whole population's genome after the reset).

**`Look.*`:** live: `bLumenTrails`, `TrailSampleInterval`, `TrailSamples`, `CreatureGlow`,
`SignalGlowBoost`, `LumenGlow`, `TectonGlow`, `DroughtBlendSeconds`, `bDroughtPreview`,
`DroughtWaterDrop`, `bScientistAvatars` (0 removes the field-team avatars on the next frame; 1 shows them
only while a policy server is sending `scientists` reports, docs/POLICY_API.md §5). Applied at the next
drought transition (the environment re-applies its drought blend
only while the blend moves; `drought=toggle` twice forces it): `SunColor`, `SunTemperature`, `SunPitch`,
`SunYaw`, `MieScale`, `FogColor`, `FogDensity`, `VolumetricFogAlbedo`, `FogDirectionalColor`,
`WaterLevel`, `WaterfallGlow`, `WhiteTemp`, `HighlightTint`, `Saturation` and their `Drought*`
counterparts. Next reset (patches respawn): `ResourceGlow`, `ResourceAGlow`, `ResourceBGlow`. Never
(the valley is built once in `ASWEnvironment::Build`): terrain, river, arches, rocks, imported asset
counts, cliff walls, post-process build values, clouds, moon, waterfalls, trace overlay colours,
`ConsoleCommands`. Do **not** live-edit the terrain fields (`ValleyDepth`, `River*`, `TerrainHalfSize`,
...): organisms stand on `SWProc::GroundZ(Look, ...)` every substep and would float above or sink into
the mesh that was built with the old values.

## `commands.csv`

One file per run directory, header written when the run log opens, one row appended (and flushed) per
executed line, accepted or rejected:

```
run_id,sim_time,wall_utc,command,result
20260906-160102_seed1_C_learning_evolution,84.30,2026-09-06T14:01:26.512Z,"drought=on","ok: drought on at t=84.3"
20260906-160102_seed1_C_learning_evolution,90.10,2026-09-06T14:01:32.117Z,"set Lumen.ReproThreshold=85","ok: 1/1 field(s) set"
20260906-160102_seed1_C_learning_evolution,95.00,2026-09-06T14:01:37.004Z,"sped=5","rejected: unknown command (drought | speed | pause | set | reset | mode | note)"
20260906-160144_seed3_C_learning_evolution,0.00,2026-09-06T14:02:08.330Z,"reset seed=3","ok: run 20260906-160102_seed1_C_learning_evolution ended at t=101.2; started 20260906-160144_seed3_C_learning_evolution (seed 3, mode C_learning_evolution)"
```

`sim_time` is the logical clock right after the command ran; `command` and `result` are CSV-quoted
(inner quotes doubled). A `reset` / `mode=` row lands in the run it **created** (the old run's logger is
closed by then); its result names the previous run and the time it ended. With `bWriteLogs=false` there
is no CSV, only the UE log lines. `python3 Tools/control.py --tail 10` prints the last rows of the newest
run.

## Determinism

A run with no control file, or with no new lines, is unchanged: the poll is a file stat. A run that
received commands is **not** reproducible from seed + mode alone, because the commands were applied at
wall-clock poll times, i.e. at whatever substep the world had reached. `commands.csv` is the record: to
repeat an experiment, replay the `set` lines as `--set` at launch and re-issue the timed commands from
their `sim_time` column (by hand or from a script watching `population.csv`). Keep `commands.csv` with
the run when you archive it.

## `Tools/control.py`

Standard library only.

```bash
python3 Tools/control.py "drought=on"                                   # validates, appends to Saved/control.txt
python3 Tools/control.py "set Lumen.ReproThreshold=85" "note=step 2"    # several lines, in order
python3 Tools/control.py --file C:/elsewhere/control.txt "speed=50"     # a sim launched with --control-file
python3 Tools/control.py --check "mode=X"                               # exit 2: rejected before it reaches the file
python3 Tools/control.py --tail 10                                      # last 10 rows of the newest run's commands.csv
```

The validator mirrors the sim's grammar; a line it rejects is never written. The HUD title block shows
`ctrl` once at least one command was accepted in the current run.
